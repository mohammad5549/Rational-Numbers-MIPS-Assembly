MIPS Assembly program using macros for rational number arithmetic

This MIPS assembly program implements basic rational number arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) using macros. The program prompts the user to input two rational numbers, selects the desired operation, and prints the result in the form of a rational number (numerator and denominator).

The code leverages the power of macros in assembly to enhance modularity and readability. Macros encapsulate common functionality like reading integers, printing strings and integers, and handling rational number arithmetic operations, allowing reuse throughout the program.
